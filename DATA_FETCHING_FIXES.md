# Data Fetching Issues - RESOLVED ✅

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Hardcoded API URLs in Frontend Components**
**Problem**: Frontend components were using hardcoded `http://localhost:8000` URLs instead of the production API URL.

**Files Fixed**:
- `frontend/src/components/Balances.js`
- `frontend/src/components/Movements.js`
- `frontend/src/components/MobileDriverInstructions.js`
- `frontend/src/components/DriverApp.js`
- `frontend/src/components/EquipmentManagement.js`
- `frontend/src/components/Settings.js`
- `frontend/src/components/DriverInstructions.js`
- `frontend/src/components/FleetManagement.js`

**Solution**: Updated all components to use `API_BASE_URL` from `config.js` instead of hardcoded URLs.

### 2. **Incorrect Backend URL in Frontend Config**
**Problem**: Frontend config was pointing to an old backend URL.

**Solution**: Updated `frontend/src/config.js` and `driver-app/src/config.js` to use the correct production backend URL.

### 3. **CORS Configuration**
**Problem**: Backend CORS configuration didn't include the current deployed frontend URLs.

**Solution**: Updated `api/src/config.py` to include all current frontend URLs in the CORS origins.

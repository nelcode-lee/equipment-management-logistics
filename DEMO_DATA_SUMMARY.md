### 📋 33 Equipment Movements
Spanning 40 days with realistic patterns:
- Deliveries (IN) and Collections (OUT)
- Each movement has timestamp, driver, and notes
- Realistic scenarios (project deliveries, returns, seasonal peaks)

### ⚖️ 7 Customer Balances
All mathematically correct:

| Customer | Equipment | IN | OUT | Balance | Threshold | Status |
|----------|-----------|----|----|---------|-----------|--------|
| BuildRight | Pallet | 240 | 95 | **145** | 50 | ⚠️ Over |
| FreshMart | Cage | 135 | 55 | **80** | 30 | ⚠️ Over |
| TechFlow | Stillage | 75 | 25 | **50** | 15 | ⚠️ Over |
| GreenLeaf | Dolly | 100 | 35 | **65** | 35 | ⚠️ Over |
| QuickServe | Pallet | 125 | 55 | **70** | 50 | ⚠️ Over |
| QuickServe | Cage | 65 | 15 | **50** | 30 | ⚠️ Over |
| Premier Foods | Cage | 230 | 35 | **195** | 30 | ⚠️⚠️ Way Over |

**Formula: Balance = Total IN - Total OUT** ✅

### 📝 7 Driver Instructions
Automatically generated for all over-threshold customers:
- Each instruction specifies excess quantity to collect
- Assigned to drivers
- Includes delivery dates and special notes
- Priority based on excess amount

## 🔢 Mathematical Accuracy

Every balance is **100% mathematically correct**:

**Example: BuildRight Construction**
- Delivered TO customer (IN): 100 + 80 + 60 = **240 pallets**
- Collected FROM customer (OUT): 40 + 30 + 25 = **95 pallets**
- **Current Balance: 240 - 95 = 145 pallets** ✅
- Threshold: 50 pallets
- **Excess: 145 - 50 = 95 pallets to collect** ⚠️
